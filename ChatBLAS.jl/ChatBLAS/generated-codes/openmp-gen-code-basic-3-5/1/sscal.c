Sure! Here's an example of a function code that scales a vector x by a constant a using C and OpenMP:

```c
#include "chatblas_openmp.h"

void chatblas_sscal(int n, float a, float *x) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        x[i] *= a;
    }
}
```

In this code, the `chatblas_sscal` function takes three parameters: `n` for the length of the vector `x`, `a` for the scaling constant, and `x` for the vector to be scaled. It uses OpenMP's `#pragma omp parallel for` directive to distribute the loop iterations across multiple threads, allowing for parallel execution. Each thread performs the multiplication of the `i`-th element of `x` by `a`.
